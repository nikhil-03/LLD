🚀 Low-Level Design & Design Patterns Hub
Welcome to LLD & Design Patterns Hub – your go-to space for well-structured, real-world, and scalable Low-Level Design (LLD) solutions and comprehensive examples of Object-Oriented Design Patterns. Whether you're preparing for a system design interview or building robust applications, this repository is crafted to boost your understanding and design skills.

✨ What You'll Find Here
🧠 Low-Level Design Solutions
Each LLD is designed from scratch with:

💡 Clear problem statements

🔍 Thought process breakdown

🧱 Scalable & modular class diagrams

🧪 Code implementations (Java)

📚 Real-world design principles & SOLID practices

🛠 Design Patterns - Explained and Implemented
All Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns will be added gradually:

🧬 Creational (Singleton, Factory, Builder, etc.)

🔁 Structural (Adapter, Decorator, Composite, etc.)

🔄 Behavioral (Strategy, Observer, Command, etc.)

Each pattern comes with:

✅ Problem scenario

🧩 UML/Class Diagrams

⚙️ Java implementation

📘 When & where to use

🚧 Work in Progress
I'm actively adding:

Strategy, Observer, Decorator

Elevator System LLD

Chess Game LLD

Splitwise Clone LLD

Parking Lot LLD

All 23 GoF Design Patterns

Stay tuned! 🌱
